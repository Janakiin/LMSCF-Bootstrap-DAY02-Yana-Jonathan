After police arrest a young suspect and release him, the father of one of the daughters takes matters into his own hands. The film was a financial and critical success, grossing US$122 million worldwide.

				<h3>Production:</h3>

				<p>Aaron Guzikowski wrote the script based on a short story he wrote, partially inspired by "The Tell-Tale Heart", involving "a father whose kid was struck by a hit and run driver and then puts this guy in a well in his backyard". After he wrote the spec, many actors and directors entered and exited the project, including actors Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio and directors Antoine Fuqua and Bryan Singer. Ultimately Guzikowski would credit producer Mark Wahlberg for getting the project on its feet, stating, "He was totally pivotal in getting the film made. That endorsement helped it get around." Principal photography began in Georgia in February 2013.</p>

				<h3>Critical response:</h3>

				<p>On review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 244 reviews, with a rating average of 7.27/10. The website's critical consensus states: "Prisoners has an emotional complexity and a sense of dread that makes for absorbing (and disturbing) viewing."[6]

				On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[7]

				Audiences polled by CinemaScore initially gave the film a grade "B+" on an A+ to F scale, but Warner Bros asked for a recount by the service and later said the film received a grade "A–".[8][9]

				Christopher Orr of The Atlantic wrote: "Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore."[citation needed]

				Ed Gibbs of The Sun Herald wrote: "Not since Erskineville Kings, in 1999, has Hugh Jackman appeared so emotionally exposed on screen. It is an exceptional, Oscar-worthy performance."[citation needed]

				Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Gyllenhaal was "exceptional" and that "Villeneuve takes his unflashy time building character and revealing troubled psyches in the most unlikely of places."[10]

				The film was a second runner-up for the BlackBerry People's Choice Award at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, behind Philomena and 12 Years a Slave. Gyllenhaal received the Best Supporting Actor of the Year Award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Festival for his "truly compelling, subtly layered" performance as Detective Loki.[11]

				Reviews have not been all positive. Writing in The New Republic, David Thompson declared that the film was "weary after ten minutes" and furthermore "hideous, cruel, degrading, depressing, relentless, prolonged, humorless, claustrophobic, and a mockery of any surviving tradition in which films are entertaining".[12] A mixed review came from Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com, who gave the film 2.5 stars out of a possible 4. She wrote that Jackman's performance grew "monotonous" and that the film sometimes verged on pretentiousness, but was redeemed by a few excellent suspense sequences and Gyllenhaal's performance, whose "subtlety is welcome considering all the teeth gnashing going on in other performances".[13]</p>

				<p id = "collapsetext" class = "pt-3 collapse">In suburban Pennsylvania, Keller Dover, his wife Grace, their teenage son Ralph, and young daughter Anna attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their friends, Franklin Birch, his wife Nancy, their teenage daughter Eliza, and young daughter Joy. The four children go for a walk and approach a parked RV. After dinner, Anna and Joy go missing. The RV is found at the edge of a wood, and Detective Loki arrests the driver, Alex Jones. Alex has the IQ of a child and would not have been cognitively able to plan the kidnapping. Forensics finds no evidence of a struggle or the girls in the RV. Pursuing other leads, Loki discovers a corpse in the basement of Patrick Dunn, a convicted pedophile priest. Dunn admits killing the man because he confessed he was "waging a war against God" by killing 16 children and would kill more. Dover, a hard driven survivalist, is furious when he hears that Alex is being released, and attacks Alex outside the police station. Alex whispers to him: "They didn't cry until I left them." Loki won't re-arrest Alex, so Dover spies on him at Alex’s aunt’s home where he often stays. After hearing him singing a song that Anna and Joy had sung, Dover abducts Alex, locking him up in his late father's abandoned apartment building. With the help of a reluctant Franklin, Dover beats him viciously when Alex won't talk. Later, Dover constructs a tiny chamber in a shower, alternating exposing him to scalding hot or freezing water.

				At a candlelight vigil for the girls, Loki notices a suspicious, hooded man who flees when Loki approaches him. Loki releases a police sketch of him. Later, the man sneaks into both families' houses but is not seen. After Loki sees Dover’s survivalist stash and learns he's been lying about where he goes at night, Loki tails Dover, and almost discovers Alex at the apartment building. Dover lied that he was going there to drink privately, and then Loki is distracted when he learns that a store clerk recognized a man from the sketch, reporting that he often buys differently sized children's clothing. Loki finds the man, Bob Taylor, and discovers walls of his house covered in drawings of mazes, and busts open crates filled with live snakes and bloodied children's clothing. Taylor had himself been abducted as a child, and at the station he confesses, but snatches an officer's gun and kills himself without revealing the girls' location. The parents of the girls positively ID some of the bloody clothes as belonging to their daughters, and everyone believes the girls dead.

				However, investigators at Taylor's house find the blood to be from pigs, and conclude he was a fake with no involvement. Loki determines that Taylor stole the clothes from the girls' homes after the abduction, for his own abduction fantasy. Dover continues to scald Alex, who incoherently talks about escaping from a maze. Dover visits Alex's aunt Holly, who tells him that Alex's disability was from an accident when he was younger, with snakes that her husband kept as pets. She says she and her husband were religious until their young son died of cancer. Loki becomes frustrated over getting nowhere with the case, but matches a maze Taylor drew while in custody with the maze necklace worn by the man Dunn killed in his basement.

				Joy is found alive by a highway, drugged. In the hospital Dover asks her for information; her memory is hazy but she mumbles: "You were there." Suspecting Joy heard his voice at the Jones' house when he visited Holly, he bolts, chased by Loki, who thinks he's returning to the apartment building. Loki searches for Dover there, but instead finds Alex. Meanwhile, Dover has gone to interrogate Holly, but she pulls a gun. She explains that before her husband disappeared, they abducted many children as part of their "war on God" to avenge their son's death, and to create demons out of the traumatized parents, like the wrathful Dover. Alex was the first child they abducted, followed by Taylor. Alex had simply taken the girls for a ride in the RV, and Holly decided to abduct them. Holly drugs Dover, shoots him in the leg, and imprisons him in a concealed pit in her yard, where he finds an emergency whistle belonging to his daughter.

				Loki goes to inform Holly that Alex has been found, not yet realizing her true involvement. Entering her house, he sees a photograph of her husband wearing the maze necklace found on the body in the priest's basement, and finally puts the case together. He finds Holly injecting Anna with a lethal drug; Holly grazes Loki in the head with a bullet, while Loki guns her down. He rushes Anna to the hospital.

				Alex is reunited with his parents. A recuperating Joy and Anna, with their families, thank a bandaged Loki, even though he confirms that Dover is likely to go to prison for kidnapping and torturing Alex. Later, Loki returns to the Jones' house, where investigators are excavating the property. As he is about to leave, he hears the whistle.</p>
